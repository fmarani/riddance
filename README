RIDDANCE
--------

A message-driven, very fast templating + mass-mailing system. This project served to me as testing ground for Scala/functional programming and to further study JMS/Messaging systems. In itself it is simple, however it uses many technologies:

- Templating engine is a simplified version of FastTemplate (old template engine written in PHP)
- Message driven architecture (using Scala/JMS)
- Mailer (written in Java, tested using gnumail)
- A piloting library written in PHP

It is not complete yet, but it will be soon!
